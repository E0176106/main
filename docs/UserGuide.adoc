League Tracker provides an alternative command to *add player faster* with less attribute input

Only `NAME`, `POSITION`, `AGE`, `SALARY`, `TEAM`, `NATIONALITY`, `JERSEYNUMBER` and `TAGS (optional)`
 are needed as input.`GOALSSCORED`,`GOALSASSISTED`,`APPEARANCE` and `HEALTHSTATUS` are set to default values (0,0,0 and Healthy)
