== Introduction

The LeagueTracker is a CLI (Command Line Interface) application written in OOP fashion with a very basic GUI.
This application is adapted from AddressBook3. It is created to provide league managers a football league operator with an efficient method of managing the league in the current season. It features many ways to keep track of the teams and players playing in the league. The LeagueTracker will make useful information of the league managed to be more organized and accessible. +

This Developer Guide provides you useful information regarding setting, coding and testing of League Tracker.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later

. *IntelliJ* IDE


=== Setting up the project in your computer
To set up this project on our computer: +

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.addressbook.Main` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level3` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level3`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your teamName fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a teamName repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

== Design

=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the League Tracker.
Given below is a quick overview of each component. +

*Main* has only one class called `Main`. It is responsible for:

* At app launch: Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.

* At shut down: Shutting down the components.


*Logic* is the command executor.

*Data* Holds the data of the League Tracker in-memory.

*Storage* Reads data from, and writes data to the hard disk.

=== Main Component
.Class Disgram showcasing the structure of Main Component
image::Uicomponent.png[width="600"]

The Main Component consists of a UI package and a `Main` class. Inside the UI package, there are various classes such
as `MainWindow`, `Formatter` and `Gui` as shown in figure 2. A `Stoppable` interface is also included which
the `main` class implements.

The UI package uses JavaFX UI framework. Layout of `MainWindow` is defined in `mainwindow.fxml` which can be found
under the same package.

The Main Component:

* Displays the CLI Gui

* Accepts input from users

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` Component

* Listens for changes to `Data`


=== Logic Component
.Class Disgram showcasing the structure of Logic Component
image::Logiccomponent.png[width="600"]

The Logic Component has a `Logic` package with a `Logic` class and a `Parser` package with a `Parser` class.

1. `Logic` uses `Parser` class in the `Parser` package to parse the user command

2. This produces a `Command` object which is executed by `Logic`.

3. The command execution can affect `Data`

4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to Ui.

5. This `CommandResult` object can also invoke actions at Ui such as displaying a message or a summary.


=== Data Component
 [to be edited]

=== Storage Component
.Storage Diagram
image::Storage.png[width="600"]

The storage component stores League Tracker data in an XML format and is able to convert it back into a human-readable format in League Tracker.

=== Common Classes
Classes used by multiple components (eg.Utils.java) are collated in the `seedu.addressbook.common` package.
(`main` > `src` > `seedu` > `addressbook` > `common`)

== Implementation

 [to be edited]
In this section, the detailed implementations of classes and features will be shown.+

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::finance[]
=== Finance feature
==== Current Implementation
The finance feature is facilitated by `AddressBook`, `GetFinanceCommand`, `ViewFinanceCommand`, `ListFinanceCommand`
`GetLeagueFinanceCommand`, `RankFinanceCommand`, `Finance`, `ReadOnlyTeam` and `Match`.

The finance feature is mainly supported by `Finance` class and `Command` class.

* The following section covers some of the feature implementation. +

1. <<Finance Class>> +
2. <<Data Processing in Finance>> +
3. <<Histogram>> +
3. <<Update of Finance Data>> +

===== Finance Class

The class diagram below illustrates the `Finance` class.

.finance class diagram
image::finance_class.png[width="200"]

The Finance class consists information of the name of the team, incomes from sponsorship and ticket sales, total incomes
within each quarter of the year and a histogram which can help to visualise the trend of changes of total income among
four quarters.

Unlike `Player`, `Team` and `Match` which need the execution of add commands to create new objects,
a `Finance` object can be created by `Finance(ReadOnlyTeam team)` based on existing teams in League Tracker.
The following sequence diagram shows how the instantiation of a Finance object works by interacting with
`ReadOnlyTeam` class and `Match` class

.finance class sequence diagram
image::finance_sequence_d.png[width="500"]

[NOTE]
This sequence diagram mainly focuses on the interaction with `ReadOnlyTeam` class and `Match` class.
The actual instantiation of a `Finance` object is more complicated than the above sequence diagram.

===== Data Processing in Finance

The `ticketIncome` in a Finance object is calculated by iterating through the relevant matches of the team which
are obtained by `getMatches()` from the target team and checking whether the team plays home or away in the
respective match to add the corresponding home or away sale to the ticket income.

.example of codes of getting total ticket income
image::code_one.png[width="500"]

Each quarter's financial income is calculated by `sponsorMoney/4` + the ticket sale income in this quarter.
The ticket sale income in a particular quarter is calculated by iterating through the relevant matches of the team
 and check if the month of the current match is within the particular quarter of the year.


===== Histogram

A histogram displaying columns of financial income in each quarter is implemented in the Finance Class.

.histogram displayed in command
image::histogram.png[width="400"]

This conversion of numbers to a graphic display is achieved by

1. finding the maximum number among the four input numbers `quarterOne`, `quarterTwo`, `quarterThree` and `quarterFour`

2. making the maximum number to be the tallest column, and then taking the height of the rest numbers proportionally

3. converting the heights of four columns to a 2D string array

4. building the 2D array to a single string

The 2D string array is converted to a single string in order to be easier displayed.

===== Update of Finance Data
Finance objects are affected if there are changes in related Team objects or Match objects ie. changes of
sponsor and ticket sales, making it dependent on these two classes. Additionally, the number of objects in
the finance list should be the same of those in the team list. For example, when a team is deleted from League Tracker,
the finance list should not display the financial condition of the nonexistent team.

A method called refreshFinance is therefore implemented in `AddressBook`. This method helps to "refresh"
finance list in `AddressBook` to get a finance list matching the current information in the league.

.example of codes of refreshFinance()
image::code_two.png[width="700"]

[NOTE]
This method is called every time information of the current financial condition of in the league is enquired.
This method is used in `ListFinanceCommand`, `GetLeagueFinanceCommand` and `RankFinanceCommand`.

{empty} +

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to update Finance objects

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a refreshFinance method in `AddressBook` to clear the old
finance list and then load new data.
** Pros: It is easy to implement. The finance list only needs to be changed at the time of enquiry.
** Cons: It may have performance issues in terms of time complexity. This method makes the time complexity of
every enquiry of the current finance list to be O(n).
* **Alternative 2:** Make corresponding changes to Finance objects every time Team objects or Match objects
are changed.
** Pros: Enquiry of information in the current finance list will be faster.
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each change is correct. The finance list will be frequently changed
even if there is no enquiry on finance.

I decide to proceed with the current implementation as it is easy to implement and more unlikely to produce bugs.

===== Aspect: Histogram display

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use available common keyboard characters to produce the histogram string.
** Pros: It is unlikely to produce unexpected message.
** Cons: It does not give a good visual effect. It requires some amount of effort to make sure columns in the histogram
 are straight as different characters do not take the same amount of space.
* **Alternative 2:** Use special characters

.example of using special characters to produce the histogram
image::histogram_special.png[width="400"]

** Pros: It produces a better visual effect.

** Cons: It is more likely to produce unexpected message from the jar file. The special characters
may not be able to be parsed correctly.

I decide to proceed with the current implementation as it is more safe in terms of producing the expected message and
less likely to raise bugs.
// end::finance[]

=== Team Feature

==== Current Implementation
* The team feature is facilitated by `AddTeam`, `ClearTeam`, `DeleteTeam`, `EditTeam`, `FindTeam`, `ListTeam`, `ViewTeam` +
* The feature mainly uses the `addressbook` class, `Team` class and the `Command` class. +

The class diagram below illustrates the `Team`class. +

* The following section covers some of the feature implementation. +

1. <<AddTeam>> +
2. <<EditTeam>> +
3. <<Point System>> +

==== AddTeam

The AddTeam Command creates a record of the team with the attributes provided by the user. +

The user is minimally required to provide the name, country and the annual sponsorship for the creation of teams. The program will automatically check for duplication of team to ensure that all team's name are unique. +

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add team mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user enters in a note with its *associated parameters*. e.g `addteam Liver Pool c/UK s/10000000`.

Step 2. The _Logic_ calls _parseCommand_ with that input.

Step 3. The _Parser_ is called and returns a _AddTeam_ object to _Logic_.

Step 4. The _Logic_ will call _execute_ method on the _AddTeam_ object.

Step 5. _AddTeam_ will call the _Team_ Constructor with the provided arguments.

Step 6. _Team_ constructor return a Team object with the provided arguments.

Step 7. _AddressBook_ is called to add Team to the teamlist in the AddressBook itself.

Step 6. If the team already exists, _DuplicateTeamException_ will be thrown. This will return a string message "This team already exists in the team list".

Step 7. Else, _add(team)_ method is called and team is added.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the mechanism for adding teams function.

==== EditTeam

The EditTeam Command edits record of a existing team with the attributes provided by the user. +

The user is minimally required to provide the at least one attribute. e.g `name, country, annual sponsorship` for the editing of teams. The program will check that for repeated team's name. +

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit team mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user enters in a note with its *associated parameters*. e.g `editteam n/Liver Pool`.

Step 2. The _Logic_ calls _parseCommand_ with that input.

Step 3. The _Parser_ is called and returns a _EditTeam_ object to _Logic_.

Step 4. The _Logic_ will call _execute_ method on the _EditTeam_ object.

Step 5. _EditTeam_ will call the _EditTeamDescriptor_ with the provided arguments.

Step 6. _EditTeam_ will call a method within it's class to genernate attributes of the edited team.

Step 7. _EditTeam_ will call _Team_ Constructor with the new attricutes.

Step 8. _Team_ constructor return a Team object with the new attributes.

Step 9. _AddressBook_ is called to remove the old Team and add the new Team to the teamlist in the AddressBook itself.

Step 6. If the team's name already exists, _DuplicateTeamException_ will be thrown. This will return a string message "This team's name already exists in the team list".

Step 7. Else, _edit(team)_ method is called with the old team removed and the new team added.

==== Point System

The Point System keeps track of the `win`, `lose`, `draw` and `points` of the team in the current league. Changes in match records will automatically result in coresponding changes to the listed attributes. +

After the matchrecord is updated, it will call for the `Team` class and performs the following action.

1. `Team` class will check the results of the matches and increment the win, lose and draw records of both teams involved.
2. The `Team` class will call for the update points method and calulate the points from the new win, lose and draw records.
3. Removal of these matches will also result in coresponding changes in the parameter

The new parametes will be reflected when `listteam` commad is called.

==== Design Consideration

Aspect: Checking for *duplicate teams* in adding

* **Alternative 1(current choice):** Implement a method to check new teams entered. If a new team has exactly the same name as exisitng teams in the League Tracker, it will be classified as duplicate team and cannot be added.
** Pros: Ease of implementation
** Cons: If the names are just slightly different it will not be able to differentiate it to be the same team. +
1. TeamA
2. Team A +

* **Alternative 2:** Implement a method to prompt user if given teams with names silmilar to existing teams' name.
** Pros: Can reduce the amount of duplicate teams that are added.
** Cons: Difficult of implemnetation and false positive could be an issue.
1. Team A
2. Team B

Final decision: Alternative 1 was chosen due to the ease of implementation.

Aspect: Prevents team's name to be edited when tied to other players or matches

* **Alternative 1(current choice):** Implement a method to check if name is edited and ensure that no match or players are tied to the team if so.
** Pros: Ease of implementation
** Cons: It becomes impossible of user to change the team's name entire without the removal of the entire team's record adding it back in

* **Alternative 2:** Implement a method to change the change of team name entire throughout the whole league tracker.
** Pros: More user friendly.
** Cons: Difficult of implemnetation and may result in slower processing as all records need to be run through at least once.

Final decision: Alternative 1 was chosen due to the rarity of team's name edited during a game season.



== Documentation
Following AddressBook3, our League Tracker uses AsciiDoc for writing documentation.We choose AsciiDoc as it provides both a human-readable,
plain-text writing format as well as a text processor and toolchain that are able to translate AsciiDoc documents into different formats(called backend),
including HTML,DocBook and PDF.

=== Editing Documentation
In your IntelliJ IDE, open `Main` > `docs` > `templates` and select the documentation file (eg. `DeveloperGuide.adoc`) to open and edit.
IntelliJ IDE will notify to download the AsciiDoc Plugin. With the plugin, a preview of the documentation will be shown on the screen when the documentation is being
edited for ease of developers.

=== Publishing Documentation
Auto-publishing of documentations has been enabled in League Tracker using Travis CI. A guide of doing so is provided below.

1. Ensure that you have set up Travis CI properly for the project.

2. On Github, create a new user account give this account collaborator and admin access to the repo.
   Using this account, generate a personal access token using this link: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new

[TIP]
Personal access tokens serve as passwords so they must be kept secret to protect your accounts. Delete and regenerate if it is leaked.

[TIP]
We use a new user account to generate the token for teamName projects to prevent teamName members from gaining access to other teamName members' repos.
    If you are the only one with write access to the repo, you can use your own account to generate the token.

   * Add a description for the token. (e.g. Travis CI - auto-publishing)
   * Check the `public repo` checkbox.
   * Click `Generate Token` to grant access for Travis CI to the repo of the project.

.Generating personal token for auto-publishing on Github
image::generate_token.png[width="600"]


=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Use asciidoctor to convert AsciiDoc files in docs to HTML format. Generated HTML files can be found in `build/docs`.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome
image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)


== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.
